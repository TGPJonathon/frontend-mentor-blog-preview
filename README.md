## Overview

This is the fastest I've finished one of these. Only took about 20-30 minutes. Getting the box shadow right was the hardest part, but I ended up using a box shadow generator for that one.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned you should not try to make a box shadow from scratch. Using a generator is much easier. It can also be a tad difficult to eyeball if margins match up.

### Continued development

I want to get better at Grid & Flex.
